# 0x1B. C - Binary Trees

## Description: 

In programming, a binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure. Each node in a binary tree has at most two child nodes, a left child and a right child. This structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

A binary tree is called a "binary" tree because each node has at most two children. This is in contrast to other types of trees, such as a binary search tree, where each node may have more than two children.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science to organize data for efficient storage and retrieval. For example, a binary tree can be used to implement a dictionary, where the nodes of the tree store the words and their definitions, and the child nodes of a node store related words and definitions. This allows for fast searching and retrieval of words and definitions in the dictionary.
